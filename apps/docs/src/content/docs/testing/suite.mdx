# Test Suite Documentation

A pragmatic test suite implementing the modern test pyramid for speed and reliability.

## Structure
```
/tests
  harness/
  contracts/
apps/web/tests
packages/backend/convex
```

## Commands
```bash
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:contracts
pnpm test:e2e:smoke
```

## CI Pipeline
- Lint/Typecheck → Unit → Integration → Contracts → E2E (on main)

## Best Practices
- Behavior over implementation
- Deterministic builders
- Contract tests for shapes
- Minimal E2E
