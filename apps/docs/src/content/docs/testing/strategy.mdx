# Testing Strategy & Implementation Plan

This page documents our testing philosophy, categories, stack, and current status.

## Philosophy
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Modern test pyramid (70–80% unit, 15–25% integration, 1–5% E2E)
- Fast, deterministic runs
- Given_When_Then naming
- No duplication across layers
- Prefer contract tests over E2E when possible

## Categories
- Unit, Integration, Contract, and E2E smoke tests

## Backend Testing (Convex)
- Vitest + convex-test
- Naming: `*.convex.test.ts`
- Builders for data, mock identity via `withIdentity()`

## Frontend Testing (React)
- Vitest + Testing Library (jsdom)
- MSW for API mocking, user-event interactions

## E2E
- Playwright, only critical journeys

## Implementation Status (snapshot)
- API Keys ✅
- Auth ✅
- Projects ✅
- Tasks ▶️ (todo)
- Ideas ⚠️ blocked by business logic
- Agents, AI, Files ▶️ (planned)

## Quality Targets
- Backend 90%+ coverage for business logic
- Error handling and permissions fully covered

## Next Steps
- Implement Tasks tests, unblock Ideas, add Agents/AI/Files suites
