# Authentication Quick Start

Get your Pulse application's authentication system up and running in just a few minutes.

## ✅ What's Already Working

The authentication system is **already configured and working** out of the box:

- ✅ **Password Authentication**: Ready to use immediately
- ✅ **OAuth Providers**: Google and GitHub configured (just need credentials)
- ✅ **Sign-in Page**: Beautiful UI with Flowbite components
- ✅ **Route Protection**: Automatic authentication guards
- ✅ **User Management**: Profile storage and session handling

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Start the Development Servers (1 minute)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Convex backend
cd packages/backend
npx convex dev

# Terminal 2: Start web application  
cd apps/web
npm run dev

# Or use the monorepo command:
pnpm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Password Authentication (1 minute)

1. Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)
2. Click **"Continue with Email"**
3. Create an account or sign in
4. ✅ **Done!** You now have working authentication

### Step 3: Set Up OAuth (Optional - 3 minutes)

If you want Google and GitHub sign-in:

1. **Google OAuth**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3003/auth/google/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Secret to `packages/backend/.env.local`

2. **GitHub OAuth**:
   - Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Create new OAuth App
   - Add callback URL: `http://localhost:3003/auth/github/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Secret to `packages/backend/.env.local`
